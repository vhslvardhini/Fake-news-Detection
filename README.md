# Fake-news-Detection
My projects helps us to detect fake news using machine learning with python


Social media interaction especially the news spreading around the network is a great source of information nowadays. From one's perspective, its negligible exertion, straightforward access, and quick dispersing of information that lead people to look out and eat up news from internet-based life. Twitter being a standout amongst the most well-known ongoing news sources additionally ends up a standout amongst the most dominant news radiating mediums. It is known to cause extensive harm by spreading bits of gossip previously.so,This Project comes up with the applications of NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques for detecting the 'fake news', that is, misleading news stories that comes from the non-reputable sources. Only by building a model based on a count vectorizer (using word tallies) or a (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) tfidf matrix, (word tallies relative to how often theyâ€™re used in other articles in your dataset) can only get you so far. But these models do not consider the important qualities like word ordering and context. It is very possible that two articles that are similar in their word count will be completely different in their meaning. The data science community has responded by taking actions against the problem.
